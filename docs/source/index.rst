Welcome to Sportyfin's documentation!
===================================

Stream sports events straight from your Jellyfin server. Sportyfin allows users to scrape for live streamed events and watch straight from Jellyfin. Sportyfin also generates meta-data that is used in Jellyfin to provide a great viewing experience.

Currently, Sportyfin supports NBA, NHL, NFL, and English football livestreams, but we plan to support other leagues in the future.

Check out the :doc:`usage<Usage>` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install<Installation>` the project.
